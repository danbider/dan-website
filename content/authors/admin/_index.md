I study probabilistic machine learning and its applications to neuroscience. I am a PhD student at the Center for Theoretical Neuroscience, advised by John Cunningham and working closely with Liam Paninski.

I work on precisely quantifying **animal movement from video** usind ideas from representation learning, computer vision, and mechanics. Inductive biases. I co-created lightning-pose, a library for semi-supervised pose estimation from videos.
I work on **scalable Gaussian processes**, developing numerical methods to accelrate inference and learning with large datastes, while carefuly studying their statistical properties.
